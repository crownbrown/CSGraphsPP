# CSGraphsPP
Implementation of both 1) an undirected graph ADT, and 2) a directed graph ADT, where the vertices and edges should be stored using an adjacency matrix. 

Operations include breadth- and depth-first searches as well as Dijkstra's algorithm:

Undirected
add_vertex()
add_edge()
remove_edge()
remove_vertex()
get_vertices()
get_edges()
is_valid_path()
dfs()
bfs()
count_connected_components()
has_cycle()

Directed Graph (via Adjacency Matrix)
add_vertex()
add_edge()
remove_edge()
get_vertices()
get_edges()
is_valid_path()
dfs()
bfs()
has_cycle()
dijkstra()
